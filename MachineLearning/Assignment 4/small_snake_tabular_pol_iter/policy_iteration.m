function [values, policy, nbr_pol_iter, nbr_pol_eval] = policy_iteration(pol_eval_tol, next_state_idxs, rewards, gamm)
%
% Code may be changed in this function, but only where it states that it is 
% allowed to do so. You need to implement policy iteration in this
% function.
%
% Function to run policy iteration to learn an optimal policy. Note that
% this implementation assumes eating apple is also a terminal state (and 
% not only hitting a wall / the body of the snake). Think about why this 
% is OK, i.e., why it will give rise to an optimal policy also for the 
% Snake game in which eating an apple is non-terminal (see also exercise 4).
%
% Input:
%
% pol_eval_tol    - Policy evaluation stopping tolerance.
% next_state_idxs - nbr_states-by-nbr_actions matrix; each entry of this 
%                   matrix is an integer in {-1, 0, 1, 2, ..., nbr_states}.
%                   In particular, the ith row of next_state_idxs gives
%                   the state indexes of taking the left, forward and right 
%                   actions. The only exceptions to this is if an action leads 
%                   to any terminal state; if an action leads to death, then
%                   the corresponding entry in next_state_idxs is 0; if an
%                   action leads to eating an apple, then the corresponding
%                   entry in next_state_idxs is -1.
% rewards         - Struct of the form struct('default', x, 'apple', y, 'death', z)
%                   Here x refers to the default reward, which is received
%                   when the snake only moves without dying and without
%                   eating an apple; y refers to the reward obtained when
%                   eating an apple; and z refers to the reward obtained when
%                   dying.
% gamm            - Discount factor in [0,1].
%
% Output:
%
% values       - 1-by-nbr_states vector; will after successful policy
%                iteration contain optimal values for all the non-terminal 
%                states.
% policy       - 1-by-nbr_states vector; will after successful policy
%                iteration contain optimal actions to take for all the 
%                non-terminal states.
% nbr_pol_iter - The number of iterations that the policy iteration runs
%                for; may be used e.g. for diagnostic purposes.
%
